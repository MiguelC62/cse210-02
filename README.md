Do you feel lucky? Try it on Hilo. The rules of this game are simple, you just have to guess if the next card will be higher or lower than the previous one. Points are gained or lost based on whether the player guessed right or wrong. A set of 13 different cards and the director shows one at a time. The player has three tries to be wrong.
